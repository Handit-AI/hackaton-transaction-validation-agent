- Coordinated multi-account attacks
- Velocity limit violations

You analyze transaction speed, frequency, and patterns to identify potential fraud.""",

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update all 5 analyzer prompts.py files with fraud-specific prompts
- [ ] Update decision_aggregator prompts.py
- [ ] Verify orchestrator node is working
- [ ] Test parallel execution with sample transactions
- [ ] Verify all analyzers return proper JSON format
- [ ] Check aggregation logic combines scores correctly
- [ ] Test with the 3 test transactions above
- [ ] Monitor execution time (should be ~3-5 seconds total)

---

## Key Success Metrics

1. **Parallel Execution**: All 5 analyzers run simultaneously (check timestamps)
2. **Consistent Output**: All nodes return valid JSON with required fields
3. **Proper Aggregation**: Weighted scores calculated correctly
4. **Clear Decisions**: Final decision matches risk score thresholds
5. **Fast Performance**: Total execution under 5 seconds
