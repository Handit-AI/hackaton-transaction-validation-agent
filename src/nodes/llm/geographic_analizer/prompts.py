{input}

Evaluate these geographic dimensions:
1. TRAVEL PLAUSIBILITY: Distance from previous location vs time elapsed
2. LOCATION RISK: Current location's fraud risk level
3. VPN/PROXY DETECTION: Signs of location masking
4. CROSS-BORDER RISK: International transaction patterns
5. LOCATION CONSISTENCY: Match between IP, billing, shipping addresses

Key location indicators:
- Current location
- Previous location
- Time since last transaction
- IP address information
- Device location data

Provide a detailed text analysis of:
- Whether the location change is physically possible (impossible travel)
- Any signs of VPN or proxy usage to mask location
- Risk level of the current geographic location
- Cross-border transaction concerns
- Your assessment of location-based fraud risk

Explain any geographic anomalies or suspicious location patterns."""
