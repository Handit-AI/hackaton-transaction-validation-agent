# Multi-Agent Fraud Detection System - Complete Implementation Plan

## Executive Overview

### System Purpose
Build an intelligent fraud detection system that analyzes financial transactions through multiple specialized AI agents working in parallel, each examining different risk dimensions, then synthesizing their findings into a single, explainable decision.

### Core Architecture Principle
**Parallel Specialized Analysis → Intelligent Aggregation → Deterministic Decision**

The system operates like a fraud investigation team where multiple experts analyze the same transaction simultaneously from their specialized perspectives, then meet to discuss findings and reach a consensus.

## 2. Node Specifications & Behaviors

### 2.1 ORCHESTRATOR NODE

**Purpose**: Initial transaction processor and analysis dispatcher

**Behavioral Description**:
The Orchestrator acts as the investigation team leader who receives a fraud alert, validates the information, enriches it with contextual data, and dispatches it to specialist investigators. It determines which analysts are needed based on transaction characteristics.

**Key Responsibilities**:
1. **Validation**: Ensure transaction has all required fields
2. **Normalization**: Convert data to standard formats
3. **Enrichment**: Add computed risk indicators
4. **Routing**: Determine which analyzers to activate
5. **Initialization**: Set up parallel execution context

**Decision Logic**:
- Always run core analyzers (Pattern, Behavioral, Velocity)
- Conditionally add specialized analyzers based on:
  - Geographic Analyzer: If location data present
  - Merchant Analyzer: If merchant data available
  - Device Analyzer: If device fingerprint provided
  - Network Analyzer: If IP/network data available

**Output to State**:
- Sets `enriched_transaction` with all computed fields
- Populates `analyzers_to_run` list
- Initializes `analyzer_states` for each selected analyzer
- Sets `analysis_mode` to "parallel"

## 3. LangGraph Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 Graph Structure Design

```
Graph Architecture:

START
  ↓
ORCHESTRATOR (Prepare & Dispatch)
  ↓
PARALLEL_EXECUTION_GATE
  ├─→ Pattern Detector ─────┐
  ├─→ Behavioral Analyzer ──┤
  ├─→ Velocity Checker ─────┤
  ├─→ Merchant Risk ────────┼─→ AGGREGATION_BARRIER
  └─→ Geographic Analyzer ───┘
                              ↓
                    Decision Aggregator
                              ↓
                    Parse Final Decision
                              ↓
                            END
```

### 3.2 Parallel Execution Configuration

**LangGraph Setup Requirements**:

1. **Node Registration**
   - Register all analyzer nodes as async functions
   - Set up proper state passing mechanisms
   - Configure timeout handlers

2. **Parallel Branch Configuration**
   ```
   branches = {
     "parallel_analyzers": [
       "pattern_detector",
       "behavioral_analyzer",
       "velocity_checker",
       "merchant_risk_analyzer",
       "geographic_analyzer"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Synchronization Barrier**
   - Wait for all analyzers or timeout
   - Collect results from completed nodes
   - Pass consolidated state to aggregator

4. **Error Handling**
   - Failed nodes return default risk scores
   - Timeouts treated as medium risk
   - System continues with available results

### 3.3 State Reducer Functions

Define how state updates are merged during parallel execution:

```
Reducer Strategies:
- analyzer_results: Merge dictionaries (no conflicts)
- risk_scores: Merge dictionaries (no conflicts)
- findings: Concatenate lists
- execution_path: Append node names
- failed_nodes: Append failures
- analysis_timestamps: Merge dictionaries
```

### 3.4 Edge Conditions

**Conditional Routing Logic**:

1. **Orchestrator → Analyzers**
   - Condition: Check which analyzers are in `analyzers_to_run`
   - Route to selected analyzers only

2. **Analyzers → Aggregator**
   - Condition: Wait for completion or timeout
   - Minimum analyzers required: 3

3. **Aggregator → Final Decision**
   - Always route (no condition)
